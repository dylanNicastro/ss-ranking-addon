# Rank Request Add-ons


Cool little features for the [ScoreSaber Rank Requests Page](https://scoresaber.com/ranking/requests) that took me way longer than it should have taken to create.

# Install

Get Tampermonkey for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/). Then install the script from [here](https://github.com/eZconfirmed/rank-request-addon/raw/master/main.user.js).

# Features

- Easily see how many more RT members are needed to qualify a map
